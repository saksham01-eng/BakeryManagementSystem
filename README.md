ðŸ›’ Order Management System
This Python-based Order Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing customer orders, ensuring data persistence, efficiency, and user-friendliness. It uses the powerful pandas library to handle order data in a CSV file, making it ideal for small-scale businesses or learning projects.

ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… Persistent Order Tracking
Reads existing orders from a CSV file (BOM.csv) and initializes the system with the highest order_id for continuity.
Automatically handles cases where the file is missing or empty, ensuring seamless operation.
âœ… Dynamic Order Creation
Use the enter_data() function to add new orders by providing:
Item name
Customer name
Quantity
Automatically generates a unique order_id for every new order.
Saves new orders to BOM.csv for future retrieval.
âœ… Easy Order Search
The search_order(order_id) function lets users search for specific orders by their unique order_id.
Displays full details if the order is found; otherwise, notifies the user that the order ID doesnâ€™t exist.
âœ… Efficient Data Export
The export_data() function appends new orders to the CSV file without overwriting existing data.
Creates the file automatically if it doesnâ€™t exist, ensuring data persistence.
âœ… Interactive Menu
The main() function provides a menu-driven interface with options to:
Add a new order
Search for an order
Exit the program
ðŸŒŸ Why Use This System?
Data Reliability: Ensures all orders are securely saved in a CSV file.
Scalability: Capable of handling large order datasets with minimal changes.
Simple & Intuitive: Ideal for beginners in Python, providing clear functions and logic for managing data.
Real-World Application: Perfect for learning how to manage and process data without requiring a database.
ðŸ”§ How It Works
The program reads the BOM.csv file (if available) to load existing orders.
Users can interact with the system through a menu to add or search orders.
New orders are appended to the file, ensuring no data is lost.
A unique order_id is generated automatically for each new order.
This project is a great starting point for anyone learning about Python data handling, file management, and basic order processing workflows. Itâ€™s simple yet practical, with room for future enhancements like database integration or advanced analytics.
